The investigation into surface water evaporation assumes paramount importance in the context of environmental change. Understanding and monitoring this natural process are essential for anticipating and comprehending climate variations, thereby offering valuable insights into more
effective management of water resources. Examining surface water evaporation becomes a pivotal element in adapting strategies to mitigate environmental impacts, particularly within the
realms of agricultural management, drought prevention, and the overall preservation of ecological balance.


The scrutiny of surface water evaporation through the analysis of time series data proves to be an invaluable approach in capturing the nuances of this variable over time. Utilizing sequential data enables the identification of trends, seasonal cycles, and anomalies, providing a profound
comprehension of fluctuations in surface water evaporation. This method also aids in highlighting intricate patterns that may be challenging to discern through point observations alone. By amalgamating the benefits of time series analysis with surface water evaporation data, we can
refine our predictive models and make informed decisions for sustainable water resource management, taking into account the temporal dynamics of this essential variable.


Our current endeavor involves a comprehensive exploration of surface water evaporation using time series analysis and machine learning models. Initially, we will examine surface water evaporation as an independent time series, delving into trends and variations over time. Subsequently, we plan to integrate the temperature variable into our analysis, aiming to unravel
the intricate relationships between temperature and surface water evaporation. This integrated approach will yield in-depth insights into the mechanisms governing surface water evaporation and foster a better understanding of the influence of temperature on this critical process.


The first phase of our project will entail a thorough exploratory analysis of the two variables in question. Moving into the second phase, we will strive to model these variables using time series and machine learning methodologies. At this juncture, we will leverage temperature variable
predictions to evaluate their efficacy in early predictions of surface water evaporation. While we retain the option to incorporate other environmental variables, it is imperative to note that predictions pertaining to these variables will be observational, with the sole aim of understanding their impact on surface water evaporation.


The overarching objective remains the development of a robust tool capable of monitoring surface water evaporation, holding promising prospects for prevention and support in agricultural practices.
